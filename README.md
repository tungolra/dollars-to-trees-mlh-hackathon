### Introduction

With the rise of fast-fashion, I wanted to make an web page that gives a useful visualization of the impact the clothing industry has on the environment.

This application allows users to compare the number of trees needed to offset each dollar that is spent to manufacture clothing by simply using a scroll bar to increase total spend.

There is also a section to educate users on the emissions of constituent gases, as well as a chart that depicts, in kilograms, how much carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide is produced.
